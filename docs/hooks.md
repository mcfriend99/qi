# Hooks

Qi provides a few set of hooks that allows us to meet different requirements at different stages of our test. There are essentially four stages that can be hooked into in a Qi test. And they are as expected:

- Before any test in a suite is run,
- After every test in a suite is run,
- Before a test is run,
- After a test is run.

### before_all

### after_all

### before_each

### after_each
